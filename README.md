Machine Learning Methods to classify arrhythmia on EKG data

This notebook and its dataset contains 452 patients with basic information such as patient height, weight, age, sex, and heart rate. It also contains data on their EKG including waveform characteristics such as peak intervals and intervals.

Five different machine learning models were used (and tuned when possible) to classify heart arrhythmias based on the pt's vitals, health information, as well as EKG data.

Through analysis, Naive bayes has been shown to provide the best combination of overall accuracy as well as least amount of false negatives.
